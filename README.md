### For your next challenge, we will be doing a pair programming challenge together. Currently we have a few broken specs and ask that you have these passing before we pair. Please also refactor this code to your liking. We are looking forward to the next stage of our interview process! 

## Fork Repo

## Setting Up DB

## Running the Specs
